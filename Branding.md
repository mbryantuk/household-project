# Brand Identity: HEARTH

**Tagline:** *The heart of your household.*

## Core Concept
The hearth is the traditional heart of the home—the source of warmth, nourishment, and community. It represents the central point where the family gathers, where assets are managed, and where the foundation of the household is maintained.

## Visual Language
* **Vibe:** Solid, Warm, Premium, Foundational.
* **Voice:** "Supportive" and "Reliable". We don't just "track data"; we "nourish the household."

* **Accent (Vitality):** `#EA580C` (Flame Orange) - Represents warmth and life.
* **Action:** `#4F46E5` (Indigo) - Standard high-contrast UI action color.
