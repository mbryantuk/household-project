# Brand Identity: MANTEL

**Tagline:** *The center of your household.*

## Core Concept
The mantel is the shelf above the hearth. In a traditional home, it is the centerpiece—the strong, structural shelf where families display what matters most (photos, heirlooms, clocks). It represents stability, warmth, and a place for valuable assets.

## Visual Language
* **Vibe:** Solid, Structural, Warm, Premium.
* **Voice:** "Architectural" but "Domestic". We don't just "track data"; we "support the household."

## Color Palette
* **Primary (Structure):** `#374151` (Warm Charcoal) - Represents the hearth/slate.
* **Accent (Value):** `#D97706` (Copper/Amber) - Represents warmth and gold/wealth.
* **Action:** `#4F46E5` (Indigo) - Retained for high-contrast UI buttons.

## Logo Concept
A stylized, flat line (the shelf) with a semi-circle arch resting on top of it (the hearth/clock), forming a subtle "M" shape.
