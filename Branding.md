# Brand Identity: MANTEL

**Tagline:** *The center of your household.*

## Core Concept
The mantel is the shelf above the hearth. In a traditional home, it is the centerpiece—the strong, structural shelf where families display what matters most (photos, heirlooms, clocks). It represents stability, warmth, and a place for valuable assets.

## Visual Language
* **Vibe:** Solid, Structural, Warm, Premium.
* **Voice:** "Architectural" but "Domestic". We don't just "track data"; we "support the household."

## Color Palette
* **Primary (Structure):** `#374151` (Warm Charcoal) - Represents the hearth/slate.
* **Accent (Value):** `#D97706` (Copper/Amber) - Represents warmth and gold/wealth.
* **Action:** `#4F46E5` (Indigo) - Retained for high-contrast UI buttons.

## UI Styles
### The Architectural Standard (Global)
All themes in the system now adhere to the high-fidelity **Architectural UI** standard.
* **Typography:** Editorial-grade headings using **DM Serif Display** for h1, h2, and h3, paired with **DM Sans** for functional body text. This evokes a "Premium Ledger" or "Editorial" feel across all palettes.
* **Depth:** Subtle glassmorphism on sidebars, soft layering with refined shadows (`shadow-sm`), and generous whitespace.
* **Structure:** Precise grid alignment and a consistent **8px (md)** radius standard for cards and containers.
* **Interaction:** Solid buttons feature subtle depth shadows, and cards provide gentle hover translations to enhance the tactile feel of the interface.

### Signature Palettes
While all themes share the same architectural DNA, the **Platinum** (Light) and **Obsidian Black** (Dark) themes are optimized specifically to showcase the highest contrast and most refined material expressions of the brand.

## Logo Concept
A stylized, flat line (the shelf) with a semi-circle arch resting on top of it (the hearth/clock), forming a subtle "M" shape.
